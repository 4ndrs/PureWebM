# PureWebM

Originally written for [PureMPV](https://github.com/4ndrs/PureMPV), with this utility it is possible to encode webms from a given input, according to a restricted file size or a default CRF (Constant Rate Factor). If the utility is called whilst encoding, additional webm parameters will be put in a queue.
